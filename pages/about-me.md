# About Me
The views on this site are my own and are not the views of my employer.
### On the subject of me
Hopefully you are here reading this because you are also passionate about
supercharging engineering using simple and open source tools. You will find
articles on Python, SysML, and my thoughts on technology.

I'm currently Functional Safety Supervisor for Ford Motor Company, which means
I help design how complex automated and electrified technologies work together
to be a safe system. I live near Detroit, MI, and I love its underdog spirit.
Prior to this, I served as a Submarine Officer in the U.S. Navy. I am
originally from California.

I am married and a father of two young kids who keep me on my toes and keep me
smiling. I commute by bicycle to work and enjoy brewing beer.
