### On the subject of me
Hopefully you are here reading this because you are also passionate about
supercharging engineering using simple open source tools and open
collaboration. You will find articles on Python, SysML, and my thoughts on
technology.

I'm currently Functional Safety Supervisor for Ford Motor Company, which means
I help design how complex automated and electrified technologies work together
to be safe systems. I live near Detroit, MI, and I love its underdog spirit. I
am originally from California. Prior to this, I served as a submarine officer
in the U.S. Navy.

I am married and a father of two young kids who keep me on my toes and keep me
smiling. I commute by bicycle to work and enjoy brewing beer.
