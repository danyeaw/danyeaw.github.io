### About Me
Welcome! If you're here, you're probably as excited as I am about empowering engineering through open-source tools and
collaborative innovation. You'll find articles here about **Python**, **SysML**, and my thoughts on the intersection of
technology and engineering.

I‚Äôm currently an **Engineering Manager for Open Source Software** at [Anaconda](https://anaconda.com), where I lead a
team of engineers who contribute to impactful projects like:

- [BeeWare](https://beeware.org)
- [PyScript](https://pyscript.net)
- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org)
- [fsspec](https://github.com/fsspec/filesystem_spec)
- [Intake](https://github.com/intake/intake)

I live near **Detroit, MI**, though I‚Äôm originally from California. Before my role at Anaconda, I led **Functional
Safety** efforts at Ford Motor Company and served as a **submarine officer in the U.S. Navy**.

Outside of work, I‚Äôm a proud husband and dad of two, and I love spending time with my family. In my free time, you‚Äôll
often find me:

- Riding bikes üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- Contributing to other open-source projects like [Gaphor](https://gaphor.org) and
  [PyGObject](https://pygobject.gnome.org)

Let‚Äôs build great things together through open collaboration!
