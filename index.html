<p>As part of modernizing <a href="https://github.com/gaphor/gaphas">Gaphas</a>, the
diagramming widget for Python, I took another look at what the best practices
are for packaging and releasing a new version of a Python library or
application. There are new configuration formats and tools to make packaging
and distributing your Python code much easier.</p>
<h2>A Short Background on Packaging</h2>
<p>There are two main use cases for packaging:</p>
<ol>
<li>Packaging a Library - software that other programs will make use of.</li>
<li>Packaging an Application - software that a user will make use of.</li>
</ol>
<p>This may not be a completely accurate definition because software does not
always fit cleanly in to one of these bins, but these use cases will help to
keep focus on what exactly we are trying achieve with the packaging.</p>
<h4>The Library</h4>
<p>The goal for packaging a library is to place it on the Python Packaging Index
(PyPI), so other projects can <code>pip install</code> it. In order to distribute a
library, the standard format is the Wheel. It allows for providing a built</p>
<p>distribution of files and metadata so that pip only needs to extract files out
of the distribution and move them to the correct location on the target system
for the package to be installed. In other words, nothing needs to be built and
re-compiled.</p>
<p>Previously if you wanted to
achieve this, it was common to have four configuration files:</p>
<ol>
<li>setup.py - The setup script for building, distributing and installing
  modules using the Distutils.</li>
<li>requirements.txt - Allow easy install of requirements using <code>pip install -r</code>
</li>
<li>setup.cfg - The setup configuration file</li>
<li>MANIFEST.in - The manifest template, directs sdist how to generate
  a manifest</li>
</ol>
<h4>The Application</h4>
<p>The goal for packaging an application is get it in the formats where you can
distribute it on the different platforms for easy installation by your users.
For Windows this is often an exe or msi. For macOS this is an app. For Linux
this is a deb, flatpak, appimage, or snap. There is a whole host of tools to
do this like:
<a href="https://py2exe.org">py2exe</a>, <a href="https://py2app.readthedocs.io/">py2app</a>,
<a href="https://cx-freeze.readthedocs.io/">cx_Freeze</a>,
<a href="https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/">PyInstaller</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/jaredks/rumps">rumps</a>.</p>
<h4>pyproject.toml</h4>
<p>On the packaging front, in May of 2016,
<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/">PEP 518</a> was created. The PEP does
a good job of describing all of the shortcoming of the setup script method to
specify build requirements. The PEP also specified a new configuration format
call pyproject.toml. If you aren't familiar with TOML, it is human-usable and is
more simple than YAML.</p>
<p>The pyproject.toml replaced those four configuration files above using two main
sections:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<code>[build-system]</code> - The build-system table contains the minimum requirements
  for the build system to execute.</li>
<li>
<code>[tool]</code> - The tool table is where different tools can have users specify
  configuration data.</li>
</ol>
<h4>The Tools</h4>
<p>Making use of this new configuration format, a tool called
<a href="https://github.com/takluyver/flit">flit</a> has been around since 2015 as a
simple way to put Python Libraries on PyPI.</p>
<p>In 2017,
<a href="https://github.com/pypa/pipenv">Pipenv</a> was created to solve pain points about
managing virtualenvs and dependencies for Python Applications by using a new
Pipfile to manage dependencies. The other major enhancement was the use of a
lock file. While a Wheel is the important output for a Library, for an
Application, the lock file becomes the important thing created for the project.
The lock file contains the exact version of every dependency so that it can be
repeatably rebuilt.</p>
<p>In 2018, a new project called <a href="https://github.com/sdispater/poetry">Poetry</a>
combined some of the ideas from flit and Pipenv to create a new tool that aims
to further simplify and improve packaging. Like flit, Poetry makes use of the
pyproject.toml to manage configuration all in one place. Like Pipenv, Poetry
uses a lock file (poetry.lock) and will automatically create a virtualenv
if one does not already exist. It also has other advantages like exhaustive
dependency resolution that we will explore more thoroughly below.</p>
<p>For Application distribution, I am going to focus on a single tool called
<a href="https://briefcase.readthedocs.io/">Briefcase</a> which along with the other set
of <a href="https://pybee.org">BeeWare</a> tools and libraries allows for you to
distribute your program as a native application to Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS,
Android, and the web.</p>
<h2>Tutorial</h2>
<p>With the background information out of the way, lets work through how you can
create a new Python project from scratch, and then package and distribute it.</p>
<h4>Initial Tool Installation</h4>
<p>To do that, I am going to introduce one more tool (the last one I promise!)
called <a href="https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/">cookiecutter</a>. Cookiecutter
provides Python project templates, so that you can quickly get up to speed
creating a project that can be packaged and distributed without creating a
bunch of files and boilerplate manually.</p>
<p>To install cookiecutter, depending on your setup and operating system, from a
virtualenv you can run:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>$ pip install cookiecutter
</pre>


<p>Next we are going to install Poetry. The recommended way is to run:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>$ curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdispater/poetry/master/get-poetry.py <span class="p">|</span> python
</pre>


<h4>TestPyPI Account Sign-Up</h4>
<p>As part of this tutorial we will be publishing packages. If you don't already
have an account, please register for an account on
<a href="https://test.pypi.org/account/register/">TestPyPI</a>. TestPyPI allows you to try
distribution tools and processes without affecting the real PyPI.</p>
<h4>Create Your Project</h4>
<p>To create the Python project, we are going to use the Briefcase template, so
run <code>cookiecutter</code> on this template:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>$ cookiecutter https://github.com/pybee/briefcase-template
</pre>


<p>Cookiecutter will ask you for information about the project like the name,
description, and software licence. Once this is finished, add any additional
code to your project, or just keep it as is for this demo.</p>
<p>Change your directory to the app name you gave (I called mine dantestapp), and
initialize git:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>$ <span class="nb">cd</span> dantestapp
$ git init
$ git add .
</pre>


<h4>Create a pyproject.toml Configuration</h4>
<p>Poetry comes equipped to create a pyproject.toml file for your project, which
makes it easy to add it to an existing or new project. To initiliaze the
configuration run:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>$ poetry init
</pre>


<p>The command guides you through creating your pyproject.toml config. It
automatically pulls in the configuration values from the briefcase-template
that we created earlier so using the default values by hitting enter after the
first six questions will be fine. This is what it provided for an output:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>Package name <span class="o">[</span>dantestapp<span class="o">]</span>: 
Version <span class="o">[</span><span class="m">0</span>.1.0<span class="o">]</span>: 
Description <span class="o">[]</span>: 
Author <span class="o">[</span>Dan Yeaw &lt;dan@yeaw.me&gt;, n to skip<span class="o">]</span>: 
License <span class="o">[]</span>: MIT
Compatible Python versions <span class="o">[</span>^3.7<span class="o">]</span>: 
</pre>


<h5>Define Dependencies</h5>
<p>The configuration generator then asks for you to define your dependencies:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>Would you like to define your dependencies <span class="o">(</span>require<span class="o">)</span> interactively? <span class="o">(</span>yes/no<span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">[</span>yes<span class="o">]</span>
</pre>


<p>Hit enter for yes.</p>
<p>For the next prompt <code>Search for package:</code> enter in briefcase. We are setting
briefcase as a dependency for our project to run.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>Enter package <span class="c1"># to add, or the complete package name if it is not listed: </span>
 <span class="o">[</span><span class="m">0</span><span class="o">]</span> briefcase
 <span class="o">[</span><span class="m">1</span><span class="o">]</span> django-briefcase
</pre>


<p>Type 0 to select the first option. and hit enter to select the latest version.
You now need to repeat this process to also add Toga as a dependency. Toga is
the native cross-platform GUI toolkit. Once you are done, hit enter again to
complete searching for other dependencies.</p>
<h5>Define Development Dependencies</h5>
<p>At the next prompt the config generator is now asking us to define our development
dependencies:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>Would you like to define your dev dependencies <span class="o">(</span>require-dev<span class="o">)</span> interactively <span class="o">(</span>yes/no<span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">[</span>yes<span class="o">]</span>
</pre>


<p>Hit enter to select the default value which is yes.</p>
<p>We are going to make <a href="https://pytest.org">pytest</a> a development dependency for
the project.</p>
<p>At the prompt <code>Search for package:</code> enter in pytest.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>Found <span class="m">100</span> packages matching pytest

Enter package <span class="c1"># to add, or the complete package name if it is not listed: </span>
 <span class="o">[</span> <span class="m">0</span><span class="o">]</span> pytest
</pre>


<p>You will get a long list of pytest packages. Type 0 to select the first option.
and hit enter to select the latest version. Then hit enter again to complete
searching for other development dependencies.</p>
<h5>Complete the Configuration</h5>
<p>The final step of the configuration generator summaries the configuration that it created.
Notice that first three sections are tool tables for Poetry, and the final one is
the build-system table.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="o">[</span>tool.poetry<span class="o">]</span>
<span class="nv">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"dantestapp"</span>
<span class="nv">version</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"0.1.0"</span>
<span class="nv">description</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">""</span>
<span class="nv">authors</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="s2">"Dan Yeaw &lt;dan@yeaw.me&gt;"</span><span class="o">]</span>
<span class="nv">license</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"MIT"</span>

<span class="o">[</span>tool.poetry.dependencies<span class="o">]</span>
<span class="nv">python</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"^3.7"</span>
<span class="nv">briefcase</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"^0.2.8"</span>
<span class="nv">toga</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"^0.2.15"</span>

<span class="o">[</span>tool.poetry.dev-dependencies<span class="o">]</span>
<span class="nv">pytest</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"^4.0"</span>

<span class="o">[</span>build-system<span class="o">]</span>
<span class="nv">requires</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="s2">"poetry&gt;=0.12"</span><span class="o">]</span>
build-backend <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"poetry.masonry.api"</span>
</pre>


<p>The dependencies use a "caret requirement", like <code>python = "^3.7"</code>. This makes
use of <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>. So in this example if Python 3.8
is released, then it will automatically update to this version. But, it won't
update to 4.0 automatically, since that is a major version change. If we put in
our configuration <code>"^3.7.2"</code>, then it would automatically update to
3.7.3 which it is released, but not 3.8, since that is a new minor version.</p>
<p>There are also "tilde requirements" that are more restrictive. So if you enter `python = "~3.7"
it will only allow update to the next patch level, like from 3.7.2 to 3.7.3. The combination
of caret and tilde requirements allows you to get updates to your dependencies when they are released, but
puts you in control to ensure that incompatible changes won't break your app. Nice!</p>
<p>The final prompt asks: <code>Do you confim generation? (yes/no) [yes]</code>. Go ahead 
and hit enter to confirm. Congrats, you have generated a pyproject.toml
configuration!</p>
<h4>Install Dependencies</h4>
<p>OK, the hard work is over, we have created our project and finished the configuration.
Now it is time to see how Poetry and Briefcase really shines.</p>
<p>To install the dependencies that you defined in the pyproject.toml, just run:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>$ poetry install
</pre>


<p>Poetry includes an exhaustive dependency resolver, so it will now resolve all of the
dependencies it needs to install Briefcase, Toga, and pytest. It will also create
a <code>poetry.lock</code> file which ensures that anyone using your program would get the
exact same set of dependencies that you used and tested with.</p>
<p>Notice that we also did not create or specify a virtual environment. Poetry automatically
creates one prior to installing packages, if one isn't already activated. If you
would like to see which packages are installed and which virtual environment
Poetry is using you can run:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>$ poetry show -v
or
$ poetry config --list
</pre>


<h4>Bundle and Run your Application for Platform Distribution</h4>
<p>For a Python Application, you want to bundle the application and all of its
dependencies into a single package so that it can easily be installed on a users
platform without the user manually install Python and other modules.</p>
<p>Briefcase allows you to package and run your app using your platform:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="o">(</span>Windows<span class="o">)</span> $ poetry run python setup.py windows -s
<span class="o">(</span>macOS<span class="o">)</span>   $ poetry run python setup.py macos -s
<span class="o">(</span>Linux<span class="o">)</span>   $ poetry run python setup.py linux -s
</pre>


<p>Your app will launch, will just be a blank window at this point.</p>
<p>Also notice that it creates a folder with the platform name that you used
above. Inside this folder, Briefcase has packaged your app for distribution on
your platform. Briefcase also has distribution options for android, ios, and
django.</p>
<h4>Build your Library for Distribution on PyPI</h4>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>$ poetry build

Building dantestapp <span class="o">(</span><span class="m">0</span>.1.0<span class="o">)</span>
 - Building sdist
 - Built dantestapp-0.1.0.tar.gz

 - Building wheel
 - Built dantestapp-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
</pre>


<p>The source distribution (sdist) and wheel are now in a new <code>dist</code> folder.</p>
<h4>Publish your Library to PyPI</h4>
<p>First we are going to add the TestPyPI repository to Poetry, so that it knows
where to publish to. The default location is to the real PyPI.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>$ poetry config repositories.test-pypi https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
</pre>


<p>Now simply run:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>$ poetry publish -r test-pypi
</pre>


<p>The <code>-r</code> argument tells Poetry to use the repository that we configured. Poetry
then will ask for your username and password. Congrats! Your package is now
available to be viewed at https://test.pypi.org/project/your-project-name/ and
can be pip installed with <code>pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/
your-project-name</code>.</p>

<p>Part of my work at Ford Motor Company is to use Model-Based Systems Engineering
through languages like SysML to help design safety in to complex automated
and electrified technologies. In my free time I took over maintaining a UML
tool called <a href="https://github.com/gaphor/gaphor">Gaphor</a> with the aim of
eventually turning it in to a simple SysML tool for beginners. I'm sure I'll
be writing about this much more in the future.</p>
<p>Eventually I got really frustrated with the current set of GUI toolkits that
are available for Python. I want the ability to write an app once and have it
look and feel great on all of my devices, but instead I was dealing with
toolkits that are wrapped or introspected around C or C++ libraries, or
visually look like a blast from past. They made me feel like I was going
against the grain of Python instead of writing great Pythonic code.</p>
<p>If you haven't heard of BeeWare yet, it is a set of software libraries for
cross-platform native app development from a single Python codebase and tools
to simplify app deployment. When I say cross-platform and native, I mean truly
that. The project aims to build, deploy, and run apps for Windows, Linux, macOS, Android,
iPhone, and the web. It is native because it is actually that platform's native
GUI widgets, not a theme, icon pack, or webpage wrapper.</p>
<p>A little over a year ago, I started to contribute to the BeeWare project. I
needed a canvas drawing widget for the app I am working on, I saw that this was
not supported by BeeWare, so I went ahead and created it. Based on my
experience, this blog post details how I would create a new widget from
scratch, now that I have done it before, with the hope that it helps you
implement your own widget as well.</p>
<p>If you are new to BeeWare, I recommend to start out with the
<a href="https://briefcase.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/index.html">Briefcase</a> and
<a href="https://toga.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/index.html">Toga</a> Tutorials, and
then the <a href="https://pybee.org/contributing/how/first-time/">First-time Contributor's Guide</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="BeeWare Logo with Brutus the Bee and text" src="images/beeware-logo.png"></p>
<p>The current status of the BeeWare project, at the time of writing this, is that
it is a solid proof of concept. Creating a simple app on macOS, Linux, or iOS
is definitely possible. In fact there is an app called Travel Tips on Apple's
App Store that was created by Russell Keith-Magee as a demonstration. Support
for some of the other platforms like Windows and Android is lagging behind
some, so except some very rough edges.</p>
<p>This alpha status may not be so exciting for you if you are just trying to
build an app, but I think it is <strong>very</strong> exciting for those that want to
contribute to an open source project. Although there are many ways to get
involved, users keep asking how they can build a GUI widget that isn't yet
supported. I think this is a great way to make a significant contribution.</p>
<p>A GUI widget forms the controls and logic that a user interacts with when using
a GUI. The BeeWare project uses a GUI widget toolkit called Toga, and below is
a view of what some of the widgets look like in Linux.</p>
<p><img alt="Example of Toga Widgets in a demo app" src="images/toga-widgets.png"></p>
<p>There are button, table, tree, and icon widgets in the example. Since I
contributed a canvas drawing widget, I will be using that for the example of
how you could contribute your own widget to the project.</p>
<p>There are three internal layers that make up every widget:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <strong>Interface</strong> layer</li>
<li>The <strong>Implementation</strong> layer</li>
<li>The <strong>Native</strong> layer  </li>
</ol>
<p><img src="images/toga-blackbox.svg" alt="Toga Blackbox" height="200"></p>
<p>As the input to Toga, the Interface layer provides the public API for the GUI
application that you are building. This is the code you will type to build your
app using Toga.</p>
<p>As the output of Toga, the Native layer connects the Toga_impl's to the Native
Platform. For C language based platforms, Toga directly calls the native
widgets. For example with Gtk+ on Linux, the Toga_gtk directly calls the Gtk+
widgets through PyGObject. For other platforms, more intermediate work may be
required through a bridge or transpiler:</p>
<ul>
<li>macOS and iOS, the Rubicon-ObjC project provides a bridge between Objective-C and Python.</li>
<li>Web, Batavia provides a javascript implementation of the Python virtual machine. </li>
<li>Android, VOC is a transpiler that converts Python in to Java bytecode.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/toga-whitebox.svg" alt="Toga Whitebox" height="175"></p>
<p>The Interface layer calls public methods that are in the Toga_core portion of
the project and this is where this Interface layer API is defined. Toga_core
also provides any abstract functionality that is independent of the platform
that Toga is running on, like setting up and running the app itself.</p>
<p>The Implementation layer connects Toga_core to the Toga_impl component.</p>
<p><img src="images/factory-pattern.svg" alt="Factory Method" height="300"></p>
<p>Toga uses the Factory Method design pattern in order to improve testability.
This pattern creates objects using a factory method instead of directly
calling a constructor. In Toga, this factory method is in Toga_core and it is
used to instantiate a platform backend as the Toga_impl like Toga_ios, Toga_cocoa
or Toga_gtk. The factory method automatically selects the correct backend based
on the <code>sys.platform</code> of the platform it is running on.</p>
<p>Toga_dummy is also a type of Toga_impl backend, and it is used for smoke testing
without a specific platform to find simple failures. When tests are initialized,
Toga_dummy is passed in as the factory. This allows the tests and the creation
of objects to be separated which improves maintainability and makes the test
code easier to read.</p>
<p>I know there is a lot there, but understanding the software architecture of
Toga together with the surrounding projects and interfaces will be key to
implementing your own widget. With that background information out of the way,
lets not delay any further, and jump in to building a widget.</p>
<h2>Step 0</h2>
<h3>Pick your development platform</h3>
<ul>
<li>Normally pick the platform that you are most familiar with</li>
<li>macOS and Gtk+ are the most developed :thumbsup:</li>
<li>Is this a mobile only widget (camera, GPS, etc)?</li>
</ul>
<p>This seems somewhat obvious, since the platform you select will most likely be
based on the laptop or other device you are using right now. But do consider
this. Most of my experience developing widgets are on Gtk+ and Cocoa so this is
where I am coming from. Implementing widgets on other platforms is definitely
needed as well, but it may be an additional challenge due to those platforms
not as well developed with Toga yet. These other platforms may be more
challenging, but they are also the areas where the BeeWare project needs the
most help, so if you have some experience with them or feel especially brave,
definitely go for it.</p>
<h2>Step 1</h2>
<h3>Research your widget</h3>
<ul>
<li>How do you create this widget on different platforms</li>
<li>Think, brainstorm, whiteboard, and discuss how you would want to create and manipulate this widget with Python</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, this is how you would draw a rectangle on a Canvas on different
platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tkinter</li>

    <span class="n">ctx</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fill</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre>


<h2>Step 2</h2>
<h3>Create the Pythonic API for your interface layer</h3>
<ul>
<li>Write your API documentation first</li>
<li>The API provides the set of clearly defined methods of communication (layers) between the software components</li>
<li>Documentation Driven Development</li>
<li>This is iterative with Step 1</li>
</ul>
<p>Start with explaining what your widget is and what it is used for. Think about
the use cases of the widget. What types of apps are users going to build with
this widget? These are the scenarios that your widget needs to be able to
support. How would a user want to use your widget? When looking at the Canvas
widgets from my research, I noticed that the current drawing widgets were very
procedural, you have to create your canvas drawing using many steps. For
example, you have to first set the color to draw with, then draw an object, and
then fill in that object.</p>
<p>Python has the context manager and the "with" statement, and making use of this
for a canvas allows the user to better break up the draw operations with some
nesting. It also allows for automatically starting or closing drawing of a
closed path for the user. This is an example of the types of things that you
can take advantage of in an API that was designed for Python. It is easy to try
to copy the API that you are familiar with, but I think you can really make
your widget stand out by taking a step back and looking at how you can make an
API that users will really enjoy using.</p>
<p>Here is an example of writing the initial explanation and widget API for the
canvas widget:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>The canvas is used for creating a blank widget that you can
draw on.

Usage
--

Simple usage to draw a colored rectangle on the screen using
the arc drawing object:

import toga
canvas = toga.Canvas(style=Pack(flex=1))
with canvas.fill(color=rgb(200, 0, 0)) as fill:
    fill.rect(10, 10, 100, 100)
</pre>


<p>Once that is complete, now might be a good time to ask for feedback to see if
you have missed any use cases or if others have any ideas of how to improve the
public API of the widget. One way to collect feedback would be to submit an
issue or a "work in progress" pull request to the <a href="https://github.com/pybee/Toga">Toga
project</a>, or ask for feedback on the <a href="https://gitter.im/pybee/general">Gitter
channel</a>.</p>
<p>Next, start to work out the structure of your Toga_core code based on your API.
I recommend creating the class and method definitions and add the docstrings to
outline what each portion of the software does and what arguments and return
values it provides. This is part of the overall documentation that will be
generated by Sphinx for your widget, and creating this before writing your code
will provide the next level of API documentation.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how that structure and docstrings would look for a canvas
widget:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Canvas</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Context</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Widget</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="sd">"""Create new canvas.</span>

<span class="sd">    Args:</span>
<span class="sd">        id (str):  An identifier for this widget.</span>
<span class="sd">        style (:obj:`Style`): An optional style object. </span>
<span class="sd">        factory (:obj:`module`): A python module that is</span>
<span class="sd">            capable to return a implementation of this class.</span>

<span class="sd">     """</span>
</pre>


<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">rect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">width</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">height</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="sd">"""Constructs and returns a :class:`Rect &lt;Rect&gt;`.</span>

<span class="sd">    Args:</span>
<span class="sd">        x (float): x coordinate for the rectangle.</span>
<span class="sd">        ...</span>
<span class="sd">    """</span>
</pre>


<h2>Step 3</h2>
<h3>Implement your Toga_core widget using TDD</h3>
<ul>
<li>Write a test for each function of the widget outlined in the API from Step 3</li>
<li>Check that the tests fail</li>
<li>Specify the implementation layer API</li>
<li>Write the core code for the widget to call the implementation layer</li>
</ul>
<p>Test Driven Development is a test-first technique to write your tests prior to
or in parallel with writing the software. I am being opinionated here,
because you don't have to write your code using this process. But, I think
this will really help you think about what you want from the code as you
implement these different API layers.</p>
<p>Toga_core has a "tests" folder, and this is where you need to create your tests
for the widget. Sometimes it can be challenging to know what tests to write, but
in the previous step you already outlined what the use cases and scenarios are for
using your widget, and the API to make use of the widget. Break this up in to atomic
tests to check that you can successfully create the widget, and then make use of and
modify the widget using all of the outlined scenarios.</p>
<p>Here is a test to check that the widget is created. The <code>canvas._impl.interface</code>
is testing the call to the Toga_impl component ("_impl") and then back to the
Toga_core component ("interface"). In other words we are testing that the canvas object
is the same object as we go to the Implementation layer to the Toga_impl and
then back across the Implementation layer to the Toga_core. The object should be
equal as long as it was created successfully. The second line of the test
<code>assertActionPerformed</code> is using the dummy backend to test that the canvas was
created, and I'll discuss that more in Step 4 below.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_widget_created</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">assertEqual</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">canvas</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">_impl</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">interface</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">canvas</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assertActionPerformed</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">canvas</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"create Canvas"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>


<p>Further along in my test creation I also wanted to check that the user could modify
a widget that was already created. So I created a test that modifies the coordinates
and size of a rectangle. </p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_rect_modify</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">rect</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">canvas</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">rect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">15</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">rect</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">5</span>
    <span class="n">rect</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">5</span>
    <span class="n">rect</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">width</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">0.5</span>
    <span class="n">rect</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">height</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mf">0.5</span>
    <span class="n">canvas</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">redraw</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assertActionPerformedWith</span><span class="p">(</span>
            <span class="n">canvas</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"rect"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="o">=-</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">width</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mf">0.5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">height</span><span class="o">=-</span><span class="mf">0.5</span>
        <span class="p">)</span>
</pre>


<p>Once you are done creating your tests and make sure that they are failing as
expected, it is time to move on to filling in all of those Toga_core classes
and objects that you left blank in the previous step.</p>
<p>Toga provides a base Widget class that all widgets derive from. It defines the
interface for core functionality for children, styling, layout and ownership by
specific App and Window. Below our class Canvas is derived from Widget and is
initialized:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Canvas</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Widget</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="fm">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">style</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">factory</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="nb">super</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="fm">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nb">id</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">style</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">style</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">factory</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">factory</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>


<p>As part of the class initialization, Toga also uses the factory method to
determine the correct Toga_impl platform, and then connect it from the
Toga_core to Toga_impl<code>self._impl</code> and back the other way using
<code>interface=self</code>:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>        <span class="c1"># Create a platform specific implementation of Canvas</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">_impl</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">factory</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Canvas</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">interface</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>


<p>Finally, we fill in our methods to call the creation of the rectangle on the
Toga_impl component using the Implementation layer:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">rect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">width</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">height</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">_impl</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">rect</span><span class="p">(</span>
            <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">width</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">height</span>
        <span class="p">)</span>
</pre>


<h2>Step 4</h2>
<h3>Implement the Toga_impl widget on the dummy backend</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dummy is for automatic testing without a native platform</li>
<li>Code the implementation layer API endpoint, create a method for each call of the API</li>
<li>Check that all tests now pass</li>
</ul>
<p>When your widget is integrated with Toga, we want unit tests to run with the
test suite automatically during continuous integration. It may be difficult
during these tests to start up every platform and check that your widget is
working correctly, so there is a Toga_impl called dummy that doesn't require a
platform at all. This allows for smoke testing to make sure that the widget
correctly calling the Implementation layer API.</p>
<p>Now go ahead and implement the Toga_impl widget on the dummy backend. There
needs to be methods for each call from the Toga_core to the Toga_impl. Below we
check that the Canvas create and rect method actions were invoked through
Implementation layer API calls.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Canvas</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Widget</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">create</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">_action</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"create Canvas"</span><span class="p">)</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">rect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">width</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">height</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">_action</span><span class="p">(</span>
            <span class="s2">"rect"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">width</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">width</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">height</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">height</span>
        <span class="p">)</span>
</pre>


<p>You now should be able to run and pass all the tests that you created in Step 3.</p>
<h2>Step 5</h2>
<h3>Implement the Toga_impl widget on your platform backend</h3>
<ul>
<li>Copy toga_dummy and create a new endpoint for the platform you chose in Step 1</li>
<li>Make use of the native interface API for this widget on your platform</li>
</ul>
<p>If after your research in Step 1, you aren't feeling confident in how the widget
should work on your platform, now would be a good time to take a break to go
practice. Build a simple canvas drawing app for your platform using the native
widgets. Once you have done that, now is the time to create the Toga_impl for
your platform that calls those native widgets on your platform.</p>
<p>In my example, Gtk+ uses an event callback to do native drawing. So I create a
Gtk.DrawingArea to draw on when my Canvas widget is created, and then I connect
that drawing callback to the gtk_draw_callback function which then calls a method
in Toga_core through the Implementation layer:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Canvas</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Widget</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">create</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">native</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Gtk</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">DrawingArea</span><span class="p">()</span>

<p>Some platforms like Android or Cocoa will require transpiling or bridging to
the native platform calls since those platforms using a different programming
language. This may require the creation of extra native objects to, for
example, reserve memory on those platforms. Here is an example of what this
extra TogaCanvas class would like with the Cocoa platform:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">TogaCanvas</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">NSView</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="nd">@objc_method</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">drawRect_</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">rect</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">NSRect</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">context</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">NSGraphicsContext</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">currentContext</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">graphicsPort</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre>


<p>Finally create each method for your native implementation. Below we create an
implementation of the rectangle creation that calls Gtk+'s cairo drawing:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">rect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">width</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">height</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">draw_context</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="n">draw_context</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">rectangle</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">width</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">height</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>


<p>After you most likely do some troubleshooting of your widget to get it to work
properly with your platform, you now should have a complete widget!</p>

<p>Tada! You did it, Submit a PR!</p>
<p>I would be interested in how it goes for you, drop me a line with your
experience creating a widget.</p>
