I recently changed jobs, and now I am an Engineering Manager for OSS at Anaconda!

This is my second major career pivot, and I thought I would share why I
decided to make the change.

## Goodbye to Ford

I spent the last 11 years leading Functional Safety at Ford. It was really
rewarding to go from an individual contributor to a manager to leading a
global team helping to ensure Ford vehicles were safe.

Although this was the role that I needed to play to support the Functional
Safety Engineers at the company, I was missing doing technical contributors
since most of my time was spent leading the team.

If there was a couple of things I would have liked to see different at Ford:

1. A strong bias for external talent with executive leadership
2. Too much bureaucracy especially for approval processes

Having a good mix of new people join an organization is fantastic. They
bring new ideas and experiences for how best to do things. However, in the
software engineering areas of Ford, they have replaced about 90% of the
executive leadership with people external to Ford. Although I wasn't trying
to obtain higher leadership positions at the company, this clear bias
towards external talent really had a negative impact on the internal
culture because it showed that development and retention of Ford team
members wasn't a priority. As can be expected, the leaders who came in
took a long time to adapt to their roles and there was also a lot of
turnover.

Executive leadership also required many levels of approval for hiring and
travel. Simple approvals often took months with no feedback.
